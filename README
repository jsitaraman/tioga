TIOGA - Topology Independent Overset Grid Assembler

Functionality:
--------------

TIOGA can perform overset grid connectivity in 3-D between
multiple unstructured (or structured) meshes that are in a distributed
computing environment, i.e. each mesh is partitioned in to multiple
parts. It can accept high-order call-back functions to perform p-consistent
interpolation and searches for formulations with internal degrees of freedom
within a computational element.

News:
-----
TIOGA is currently under development with funding from the DoE ExaWind program
towards developing overset capability in the DoE NALU code for large scale
wind farm simulations
